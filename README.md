All these achievements are unique and interesting in their own way. Some of them you will get as you progress through the levels, and for some you will have to do level research, or hone your skills to complete them.

## Coins: 

In addition to achievements, here is a player reward system - Coins, which you can get by completing and claim achievements. The amount of reward varies depending on the difficulty of the achievement.

You can use your Coins to buy unlockable items in supported mods.

## Modding:

Also, despite all the basic features of the mod, we provide opportunities for other modders to use our functions in their mods. This means that other mods can create their own custom achievements, add them to the list in the menu, and set their own conditions for completion.

Achievements Plus is happy to provide all the tools and documentation for using our features and functions. Check out the tutorials of <a href="#">How to use Coins</a> and <a href="#">How to create custom Achievements</a> right now on gamebanana!

Any mod that provides Community achievements should be installed above.
